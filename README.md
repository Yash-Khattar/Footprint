# Footprints

Many small-scale NGOs that operate at the root level, often lack funding due to two reasons.
1. Corporates, who are required the give CSR funds generally tie up with large NGOs hence the small NGOs suffer financially.
2. Lack of awareness among individuals.

Footprints, brings a unique solution to above problem!

Footprint is a Activity Tracking App, that converts user's physical activity to coins that can be donated by the user to his choice of NGO.
The project tackles the serious issue of short funding and lack of awareness about NGOs, leading them to stop functioning.
